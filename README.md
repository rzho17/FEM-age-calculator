## My process

I started by designing the mobile design first and added any remaing divs / styles needed to complete the project. As for the javascript section, I tried to figure out a solution first to calculate the age of the user but eventually had to look up other resources as I could not figure out how to do it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first work-flow
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I got to practice getting user inputs as data and using it in other processes. I also got to learn how to create errors for each error case on invalid inputs.

### Continued development

I would like to learn how to develop the sliding animation that was mentioned, but I feel I have spent enough time on this project and need to keep moving forward to continue improving my skills and other projects.
